# Data Science Salary Analysis part 6

## Part 1
With part one we see the starting of the foundation of this assignment. As we look into the salary of **581 Data Scientists** and try to find correlation, the most notable difference within the dataset so far is the majority. The majority of Data Scientists make **50k - 150k** with the **mean standing at 115,601.76 USD**. Noting that the outliers of this data set sitting at **600,000 USD** and **2,859 USD** are ones that could skew the data quite a bit.

## Part 2
With this part we are going to explain the important details of each level of work within Data Scientist and finding the notable information within. 

- **Entry Level (EN)**: We can find that the main cluster of salaries close in around the **75,000 USD** mark suggesting the average of the EN is around that, with the outliers included turning the average to **65,250 USD**.
- **Mid-Level (MI)**: There is an average increase of **39%** from the EN. We think that this is due to the higher ceiling involved with a higher position. Finding the cluster of salaries to be around **91,100 USD** we can assume that through the experience gained they are worth more than an Entry Level Data Scientist.
- **Senior-Level (SE)**: We can again see a very large increase in the average of salaries than the MI being at **91,100 USD** and the SE being at **140,100 USD**. It's important to note that as the averages are increasing the ceilings to cap of the available earnings are also increasing. This is due to the value they create with the amount of years working in this field.
- **Expert-Level/Director (EX)**: We find how they are getting paid much more with the salary average becoming **204,200 USD**. With this position with the outlier of **600,000 USD** we have to look at the cluster for this one to find the true average of what these Data Scientists get paid.

Overall we understand that as time and experience grows and promotions happen. The more a Data Scientist can expect to get paid. We see that the largest increase in average salary is from mid-level to senior data scientist with over **50% avg salary increase**, and the smallest increase in average salary is from entry-level to mid-level with only roughly **39% average salary increase**.

## Part 3
As we go onto talk about the size versus pay gap between smaller and larger companies we have to take into consideration these different roles we have outlined above. With these averages and differences we can expect before looking into the data some similarities. Because in the end we can find the importance of each role and their average and usually with the cluster of data points we can see they usually stay around that point.

- Now with the smaller companies we can see that they usually pay less than **100,000 USD**. This is to be expected for **2 reasons**:
  1. They do not have the same amount of money built up like older companies.
  2. They do not have the money to spend on older more seasoned veterans therefore they have to pay for newer people and because they are newer they are worth less. This brings down the company average to below **100,000 USD** due to the EN average or even the MI average.

- Along with the medium companies, from the numbers I will group them with the larger companies notably for one reason. From the tables shown above it seems that they have the money to pay what everyone is worth. Because the need for each role in different companies are around the same, and the price being set for the average of each role. We can assume that because the medium age companies and the older companies have been set into a foundation and have money, they can pay what Data Scientists are worth. Therefore their amounts would nearly add up the same. It is important to note that within our findings the larger companies with much more money have bigger outliers with their higher ups have the ability to get paid much more like the outlier with **600,000 USD**.

## Part 4
Within this finding we can see that there are more Scientist/Analysts than Engineers that fall under the umbrella of Data Scientist's. This is interesting because the question comes up, **Does that title have any effect on your pay?** These are things that could matter and I think it is quite interesting to see the difference between the two. I think the ability to see the difference is interesting to create more questions for yourself. For example, **Do you not need as many engineers as people there to test and understand the work engineers do?** or **Vice-Versa?** I think this was a good analysis to do to create these questions to help understand and think more about these jobs.

## Part 5
With this we are looking at the needs for smaller, medium, or larger companies. I think the most notable difference is the need/ability that these companies have to pay or employ all the possible positions within becoming a Data Scientist. The larger companies only have **10 NaN's** which mean only **10 roles that are not filled** while the medium companies have **15 Nan's** while the smaller companies have up to **25 NaN's**!!! The most notable thing to realize here is that the size of the company does affect what roles are employed. While the larger companies have the need for more roles the medium and smaller companies can fill in and do more things under one title due to maybe money or the true need for it.
